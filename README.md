# Ocean Temperature Prediction

This repository contains various projects and analyses related to ocean temperature prediction and coral bleaching. The main focus is on using machine learning techniques to understand and predict ocean temperature patterns and their effects on marine ecosystems.

## Linear Regression - Predicting Coral Bleaching

This project uses linear regression to predict coral bleaching events based on ocean temperature data. It demonstrates the relationship between rising ocean temperatures and the health of coral reefs.

## Notebooks

- `Geographic_Data.ipynb`: Analysis of geographic data related to ocean temperatures.
- `descriptive_ocean_data.ipynb`: Descriptive analysis of ocean temperature data.
- `geographic_tutorial.ipynb`: A tutorial on working with geographic data in the context of ocean temperature analysis.
- `practice.ipynb`: Practice exercises and experimental code related to the project.

## Main Script

- `main.py`: The main Python script for running the ocean temperature prediction models.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/S-Romberg/ocean_temp_prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies (list of dependencies to be added).
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data analysis process.
4. Run `main.py` to execute the main prediction model.
